## **Getting started with Open Source**

Here's a quick run down on how to get started with open source, first of all let's know some basic terminologies:

- Git: is a versioning system that let's you store your code and code history on your local computer preventing loses and allowing sharing of that code
- Github: is a server that let's you store the history in a database
- Open Source: A project is said to be open sourced if you can see the code on GitHub
- Fork: This is a copy that you make of a project on GitHub, it gets added to your repositories
- Repository: A project on GitHub is called a repository
- Pull Request: This is a fix for an issue proposed to be done in a project, this consists of you editing a file in the project.
- Issue: An issue is a change that should be done in a project, can be a bug, a new feature or a suggestion to a project
- Branch: A branch is a new workspace derived from the default workspace(main or master), it allows you to work on something without affecting the original code.
- Star: When you star a repositiory, it gets saved at your profile and you can easily re-visit it later.
